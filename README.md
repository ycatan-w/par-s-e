# par-s-e

**par-s-e** ‚Äì *pronunciation*: `\pa. Å…õ.s√∏\`
**Pronunciation (French):** "par S E" ‚Äì like "paresseux"

A lightweight manager for the kind of scripts you write when you‚Äôre too lazy to type long commands.

You know the ones:

* `push-branch.sh` ‚Äî so you don‚Äôt have to type `git push origin <branch>` every time.
* `copy-branch.sh` ‚Äî because right-click + copy is *too much effort*.

par-s-e gives those ‚Äúlazy scripts‚Äù a proper home:

* install, update, and remove them with a single command
* browse what‚Äôs available with a clean catalog view
* manage aliases so your shortcuts are even shorter

Because if you‚Äôre going to be lazy, you might as well be **organized about it**. ü¶•

## Installation

Clone the repository and run the installer:

```bash
git clone <repo-url> ~/par-s-e
cd ~/par-s-e
./install_par-s-e.sh
````

This will:

* Create `~/.par-s-e/bin` for the scripts.
* Symlink `par-s-e` to your `BIN_DIR`.
* Install autocompletion for Bash/Zsh.
* Warn if `~/.par-s-e/bin` is not in your PATH.

## Adding Your Scripts

To make scripts available for `par-s-e`:

1. Place your scripts inside the `scripts` folder **inside the repository**:

```text
~/par-s-e/scripts/<my_script.sh>
```

2. Make sure the script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/par-s-e/scripts/<my_script.sh>
```

3. The scripts will automatically appear as available when running:

```bash
par-s-e catalog
```

4. Install the script with:

```bash
par-s-e install <my_script.sh> [<alias>]
```

**Directory structure example:**

```text
~/par-s-e/
‚îú‚îÄ scripts/
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ my_script.sh
